# sh4 boxes require some headers from the kernel modules (for the framebuffer and ioctls) which are not shipped by the kernel headers. In order to avoid adding explicit sh4-conditional dependancies to the driver package in several packages (just for a couple of generic headers) we add them here. In this way, we also avoid unnecessary rebuilds of several stuff when drivers are updated.
